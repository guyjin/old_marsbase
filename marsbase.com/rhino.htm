<h1>T-9 Rhino</h1>

			Early morning mist slowly moved through the valley.  Quietly, men began moving, going through the ministrations of a new day.  Low laughter and the sound of metal on metal carried across the still morning air as small cook fires were lit.  The sun had yet to move above the low hills, but it's light diffused through the fog, lending an unearthly quality to the landscape.<p />
	Above the camp, just below the crest of one of the surrounding hills, a figure lay unseen.  Slowly, with exaggerated care, she pushed herself down from the slope until she was out of sight.  She rolled onto her back to stare into the brightening sky.<p />
	Getting in there hadn't been much of a challenge.  M6 (intelligence) said the Mars Liberation Front (MLF) had never been known for its unit training, and their field security certainly gave confirmation to that little tidbit.  Slowly, Lance Corporal Tammy Morrison worked her way down the slope, back to her Gnat hover cycle. <p />
	The really surprising thing, she thought, was that the MLF managed to stick around at all.  Except for a few bombings here and there, the SpaceCorps had pretty much been eating them for lunch.   It was only a matter of time until the group was driven completely into the ground.<p />
	Morrison shook her head.  She was only six months away from her mecha boards.  She'd passed her intermediate and advanced piloting certifications, as well as small group tactics at the Olmsford School.  Instructors stressed identification almost from day one.  Know your enemy.  Know your enemy.  Know your enemy.  As a forward scout, Morrison knew the value of correct information.  Most candidate pilots these days concentrated only on ID'ing current mecha designs.  Morrison however, had taken an early interest in obsolete and exotic mecha as well.  She'd spent extra time in the simulator to become proficient at identifying targets with minimal data.  Her favorites had been the exotics, like the T-9 Rhino.<p />
	The T-9 Rhino had been the behemoth of it's day.  Forty tons of armor, guns and general nastiness housed in a boxy chassis slung between four heavily armored legs.  The Rhino had also been unique for its' day, using its' four massive legs to get around instead of the more popular and easier to maintain two.  The Rhino had, unsurprisingly to its' critics, actually failed miserably in the field.  It was much to slow, and its' weight was a severe problem when needing to move cross-country. It wasn't until an enterprising young lieutenant had reactivated an abandoned Rhino found behind his unit's motor pool that things changed.  The Rhino was successfully used it to defend his unit's position against a probe by a Kelisian mechanized company. The Rhino's true vocation had been discovered.  The Rhino was an excellent defensive platform.  The newer, better armed and armored Kelisian units had been utterly annihilated by the single Rhino.  The Rhino's main gun, a Warskoski phase cannon, had gutted them like fish.  It's rapid rate of fire provided an utterly devastating defense.  The twin missile pods on the rear deck of the Rhino's chassis weren't even activated.<p />
	For a while, the Rhino became the darling of planetary defense units everywhere, seen as something of a status symbol for military commanders.  Its presence in unit strength has been documented to have forestalled enemy action on three separate occasions.  However, the Rhino never effectively served again in an offensive unit.  In fact, the one time Rhino's were deployed offensively at Gehonine (Jee-hoo-nin) IV, the faster units of the opposition forces wiped them out with stand off weaponry.  The Rhino's simply were unable to maneuver quickly enough to meet their enemies effectively and the Warskoski gun didn't have the range to engage.  The unit's commander was cashiered shortly thereafter.<p />
	Dispite its' successes, the Rhino slipped from active duty.  Difficulty with maintenance and parts availability coupled with advances in armor technology that had effectively blunted the Warskoski's effectiveness sounded the death knell of the Rhino.<p />
	All of which was really interesting to Lance Corporal Morrison, but it didn't explain what the MLF was doing out here, only four kilometers from her Battalion's HQ.  Nor did it explain how they'd gotten or what they intended to do with the two factory fresh Rhinos she'd just seen parked in the glen.  With a shake of her head she snapped her helmet's visor down, started her Gnat, and accelerated away, back to the 137th SpaceCorps Battalion's headquarters.
